Well, just another repository

Hi Humans,

James here, just got back off a spaceship on a round trip in the land of aliens. yes they also have land, where did you think they lived. Contrary to want you might think they have smaller heads than humans and have little technological advancements. Their food is to die for though....or you might become their food.
